# FastRTP
    What is FastRTP ?

FastRTP is a plugin that allows you to teleport randomly in the world between ranges. It finds a location quickly despite the constraints you can put on it to avoid your players spawn in the lava for example. It is designed to consume the least amount of resources on your server. It is compatible with /reload!

    How does it work ?

After placing it in the "plugins" folder of your server and restarting it. The plugin will automatically create a config.yml and a lang.yml file in your home folder.
After configuring and translating it, you can restart or reload it, the plugin will take effect immediately and allow you via the command /rtp [player] to RTP yourself or one of your players.
Now you can offer a fast and latency-free random teleportation to your players!

    Command
- /rtp[player]
  desciption: Starts an RTP on you or on the specified player.
  perm: "fastrtp"
